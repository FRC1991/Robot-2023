### Electronics

For this year we transitioned over to the [REV PDH](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1850/). We used a total of 13 [neos](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-21-1650/) and 1 [neo 550](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-21-1651/) all controlled by [Spark max motor controllers](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-2158/). 6 of these motors are on the drivetrain. 2 are used to lift the arm. 1 is used to extend out our arm. 2 are on the turret. 1 is to rotate our claw and the final motor a neo 550 is used to open and close the claw. We also a total of 5 [physical limit switches](https://www.grainger.com/product/6X292?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:4P7A1P:20501231&gclid=CjwKCAiAr4GgBhBFEiwAgwORrT3ftxPCb0evrn4rLCS0Aeh5ITvAahquKXvPsfDpjy86tjAc203kpBoC9pIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and 2 [IR beam sensors](https://learn.adafruit.com/ir-breakbeam-sensors). The limit switches are used to make sure we do not over extend any part of our robot while the IR sensors are used to center our 2 turrets. We also used two [limelights 2+](https://limelightvision.io/collections/products/products/limelight-2-plus) to wire these up we used a [TP link ethernet switch](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Ethernet-Splitter-Unmanaged-TL-SF1005D/dp/B000FNFSPY/ref=asc_df_B000FNFSPY/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309707619534&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5951270540427691936&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003242&hvtargid=pla-352077286959&psc=1) to overcome the one port limitation on the [radio](https://www.andymark.com/products/open-mesh-om5p-ac-dual-band-1-17-gbps-access-point-radio). The radio and limelights were wired using [POE injectors](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1210/). We also used [wago connectors](amazon.com/221-2401-WAGO-Lever-NutsÂ®-2-Conductor-Transparent/dp/B0BKR2SR7H/ref=sr_1_8?gclid=CjwKCAiAr4GgBhBFEiwAgwORrZ19wbIXQFmEIOo78psZ8gifpKCuclsqIOggxwHXLDQYCLN_y2NBBxoCZJYQAvD_BwE&hvadid=236856702852&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9003242&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=18177757179304087033&hvtargid=kwd-390596553309&hydadcr=25968_9904055&keywords=wago+electrical+wire+connectors&qid=1677777452&sr=8-8) everywhere we could we highly reccomend these connectors they save an incredible amount of time. Finally we ran everything though a cable chase. This is it for electonics come to our pit for more infomation. We would be happy to help.
